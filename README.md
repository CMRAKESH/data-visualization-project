# data-visualization-project
This project demonstrates the process of transforming raw data into meaningful visual insights using Python. It focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques to better understand the dataset and support decision-making. The project uses the Iris dataset as an example but can be adapted to any dataset.
