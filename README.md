# data-visualization-project
This project demonstrates the process of transforming raw data into meaningful visual insights using Python. It focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques to better understand the dataset and support decision-making. The project uses the Iris dataset as an example but can be adapted to any dataset.
# Data Visualization Project

## Overview

Transform raw data into meaningful insights using Python. This project demonstrates **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **visualizations** on the Iris dataset.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Key Features

* Histograms for feature distributions
* Boxplots to detect outliers
* Scatterplots for relationships between variables
* Pairplots for multi-feature comparison
* Heatmaps for correlation analysis
* Saving plots for reports and portfolio

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Run all cells sequentially.
4. Replace the dataset with your own CSV if needed.

## Learning Outcomes

* Visualize data to uncover insights
* Create interactive and meaningful plots
* Build a portfolio-ready project
